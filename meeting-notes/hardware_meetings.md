Austin presented a comparison of different 3d printers, will do more research
in the ~$1500 price range and then we will send our recommendations to Steve.

John: Make attachments that can fit onto out-of-the-box parts - we will have to figure
out how to attach top half-sphere, and how to attach microcontrollers and
batteries to top (velcro?). We should add through-holes for wires. will send cad
files within a week.

Chris: 1 inch diameter electromagnets have 10 lb pull force. Smaller electromagnets
have 4 lb pull force. Will make writeup with a wishlist, including batteries
needed to power the emags, and supplies for experimenting with making our own.

Alli: Will order parts when people send them to me. Will take another look at
the poll - Mondays?
