----------

-   Chris has ESPs working over non-Illinois wifi
-   Will contact engrIT about ports; if not, we will get a router
-   Updated code a little
-   Boards should ship next week
-   Will need to buy filament for the long term - Chris will get recommendation
    for department

2017-06-09
----------

-   Chris: PCBs
-   Chris: will work in lab in afternoons 2-5pm
-   Chris will work on microcontrollers
-   Austin will have class 1-5pm every day
-   Austin will have CAD designs and passive connector report by next week
-   tentatively 11am Friday meetings
-   look into MEL training/printing
-   goal is three robots by July 1
-   will purchase filament for use in ECEB

2017-05-15
----------

-   getting organized after finals
-   Alli will be out of town May 18-28
-   Chris will be back in a week, then going backpacking
-   John will be in Spain for 8 weeks!
-   board is 20x40mm: make a slot for the board in CAD. Chris will do this, will
    talk to Alli about submitting for purchase
-   Alli will submit board order today
-   Austin: been researching connectors
    -   hard to find papers
    -   quantitative and qualitative comparision of connectors
    -   will finish up by end of this week

2017-05-01
----------

-   Chris has finished a first draft of the electromagnet controller board!!
-   It's kind of big - check with John to make sure it will fit, make a groove
    in the 3d printed part to hold it in place
-   Alli has not printed anything yet - will hold off for next draft with chip
    holder
-   Alli feels that RPlab is our best bet for manufacturing lots of parts - not
    the cheapest but it's close by and easy to submit orders to
-   Chris can draft up a step-down circuit as well (12V series batteries -> 5V
    for switch -> 3V for ESP8266)
-   As soon as the board, part designs are done Alli can submit

2017-04-24
----------

-   Chris and Austin will be here over the summer! Will keep working on robots
-   Chris could make electromagnets that are about half the weight
-   Chris will make PCBs for controlling the electromagnets ($2-3 per chip for
    10 chips) - could allow variable strength
-   may need to buy long screws to hold attatchment in
-   Alli will print ~12 attachment
-   Austin has been doing some really cool research into passive attachments,
    will make a write up for next week
-   Alli will look into printing options (maybe use ECE lab)
-   Chris has simulator on the back burner for now, will come back to it after
    ordering PCBs

2017-04-17
----------

-   no part yet - tomorrow or tuesday
-   junwu is working on microcontrollers
-   Chris is working on controller board for magnets
-   Chris has made mucho progress on python simulator! Will port to pygame and
    put it on the self-aSsembly github. Will also meet with John to do code
    review / pair-programming

2017-04-03
----------

-   need to submit print job today - I think we should add supports ourselves
    -   new design will be finished Wed night
-   no updates on microcontrollers (will get part today)
-   python simulator is almost up and running (Chris will work on viz)
-   magnets are working - strong local pull. will they ever connect?
    -   maybe we should curve the outside of the attachments?

2017/03/13
----------

-   microcontroller update
    -   need to figure out networking: Alli will talk to EngrIT and possibly do
        some sketchy stuff with the router
-   printer spreadsheet?
    -   on github now
-   python simulator?
    -   looking good, hard modelling decisions
-   will let you know when part is done

Friday at 1:30pm: meeting

2017/03/06
----------

Alli: ordered electromagnet stuff on Friday, Li will be coming in on Thursday at
2pm to work on programming microcontrollers / networking.

Austin: presented 3D printer options, will upload to github

John: will send CAD files today by 3pm. Is confused about git, Alli will send
another tutorial.

Chris: still working on python simulator, will try to have working prototype by
next week.


Goals/checkpoints:

- one week: working microcontrollers
- one month: working robot prototypes



2017/02/24
----------

Austin presented a comparison of different 3d printers, will do more research
in the ~$1500 price range and then we will send our recommendations to Steve.

John: Make attachments that can fit onto out-of-the-box parts - we will have to figure
out how to attach top half-sphere, and how to attach microcontrollers and
batteries to top (velcro?). We should add through-holes for wires. will send cad
files within a week.

Chris: 1 inch diameter electromagnets have 10 lb pull force. Smaller electromagnets
have 4 lb pull force. Will make writeup with a wishlist, including batteries
needed to power the emags, and supplies for experimenting with making our own.

Alli: Will order parts when people send them to me. Will take another look at
the poll - Mondays?
