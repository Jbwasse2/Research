-   no part yet - tomorrow or tuesday
-   junwu is working on microcontrollers
-   Chris is working on controller board for magnets
-   Chris has made mucho progress on python simulator! Will port to pygame and
    put it on the self-assembly github. Will also meet with John to do code
    review / pair-programming

2017-04-03
----------

-   need to submit print job today - I think we should add supports ourselves
    -   new design will be finished Wed night
-   no updates on microcontrollers (will get part today)
-   python simulator is almost up and running (Chris will work on viz)
-   magnets are working - strong local pull. will they ever connect?
    -   maybe we should curve the outside of the attachments?

2017/03/13
----------

-   microcontroller update
    -   need to figure out networking: Alli will talk to EngrIT and possibly do
        some sketchy stuff with the router
-   printer spreadsheet?
    -   on github now
-   python simulator?
    -   looking good, hard modelling decisions
-   will let you know when part is done

Friday at 1:30pm: meeting

2017/03/06
----------

Alli: ordered electromagnet stuff on Friday, Li will be coming in on Thursday at
2pm to work on programming microcontrollers / networking.

Austin: presented 3D printer options, will upload to github

John: will send CAD files today by 3pm. Is confused about git, Alli will send
another tutorial.

Chris: still working on python simulator, will try to have working prototype by
next week.


Goals/checkpoints:

- one week: working microcontrollers
- one month: working robot prototypes



2017/02/24
----------

Austin presented a comparison of different 3d printers, will do more research
in the ~$1500 price range and then we will send our recommendations to Steve.

John: Make attachments that can fit onto out-of-the-box parts - we will have to figure
out how to attach top half-sphere, and how to attach microcontrollers and
batteries to top (velcro?). We should add through-holes for wires. will send cad
files within a week.

Chris: 1 inch diameter electromagnets have 10 lb pull force. Smaller electromagnets
have 4 lb pull force. Will make writeup with a wishlist, including batteries
needed to power the emags, and supplies for experimenting with making our own.

Alli: Will order parts when people send them to me. Will take another look at
the poll - Mondays?
