==========

Decided to hold hardware meetings 11am on Mondays. In the lab.

Software is staying 2pm on Wed, in 4124.

Everyone is on the self-assembly github now.

Went through "basic-haskell" assignment, getting familiar with recursion, list
operations, data types. Next week, Li and Justin will present on consensus
algorithms, the types of modelling choices made in consensus algorithms, and
what is relevant for our project.
